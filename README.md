  🎓 <strong>AI & Data Science Graduate</strong> | 🕸️ <strong>Co-Founder @ spydX</strong> | 🤖 <strong>ML Developer who experiments & ships</strong>

I’m an AI & Data Science engineer who **learns by building**. I’ve shipped projects that range from medical assistants to lead scoring bots, because I like seeing models make sense in the real world — not just sit in a notebook.

I co-founded **spydX**, where we build tech tools, train students, and prove that a tiny team with enough grit can deliver solid solutions — from websites to AI integrations.

My work is practical, human-focused, and sometimes a bit messy — but that’s how you grow:
- 📊 I’ve built ML models with real accuracy, not just toy datasets.
- 🗣️ I experiment with voice AI, NLP, and automation.
- 🕸️ I turn ideas into working demos that people can actually use.
- 🤝 I share what I know — because the next coder might build something better.

### 📌 What I’m working on now
- ⚙️ Launching **spydX** as a real student tech community and services brand.
- 📰 Building **AutoBrief**, an AI news summarizer with bias detection.
- 🩺 Improving **Medico**, my final year project for safe medical guidance.
- 🔗 Keeping my GitHub real — no fake projects, only what I’m actually learning and shipping.
